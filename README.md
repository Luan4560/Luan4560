# Luan Nascimento

## Hello There. ðŸ‘‹
Hello, my name is Luan and I'm a highly experienced developer with over 6 years of professional experience. My primary focus is on frontend and mobile development, specifically using React and React Native. Additionally, I have a strong passion for information security, which has led me to develop a deep understanding of this area.

Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work with both small and large teams of developers from around the world. I have worked on some of the most challenging and significant projects, including those for one of the biggest e-commerce companies in my country and other notable projects in different countries.

With my extensive experience and technical skills, I am confident in my ability to take on any project and deliver high-quality results. I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my skill set and knowledge, and I look forward to collaborating with other professionals in the field.
